# Python-NLP-SentenceEmbedding

The objective of this notebook is to develop a proof of concept for Glassdor, where it can improve its actual reviews for each company using NLP techniques such as Sentence Embeddings.

Firstly the data (reviews) is gathered via Web Scraping directly from the page. Afterwards, this is the dataset used for the Sentiment Analysis and Sentence Embedding sections.
